<h2><span class="u">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 30px;">
<img src="images/i-t.png" width="30" height="34" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><div class='unindent'>O the modern wide-awake, twentieth-century woman efficiency
in household matters is quite as much a problem
as efficiency in business is to the captains of industry.</div>

<p>How to make pure food, better food and to economize on the cost
of same is just now taxing the attention and ingenuity of domestic
science teachers and food experts generally. The average housewife
is intensely interested in the result of these findings, and must keep
in touch with them to keep up with the times and run her home in
an intelligent and economical as well as healthful routine.</p>

<p>The eternal feminine question is, "What shall we have for dinner
to-day?" It is not always the easiest thing in the world to think of
a seasonable menu, nor to determine just the right combination that
will furnish a meal appetizing and well-balanced in food values.
Furthermore, both the expense and the amount of work entailed in
preparation must be considered.</p>

<p>This Cook Book is especially designed to meet just that pressing
daily need of the housewife. It presents for her guidance a menu for
every Sunday dinner in the year; it suggests dishes which are seasonable
as well as practical; it tells in a simple, intelligent manner just
how these dishes can be made in the most wholesome and economical
form; and the recipes have all been especially made for this book
and tested by that eminent expert, Mrs. Elizabeth O. Hiller.</p>

<p>The title of "52 Sunday Dinners" has been given the book because
Sunday dinners as a rule are a little more elaborate than the
other dinners of the week, but from these menus may be gleaned
helpful hints for daily use.</p>

<p>While climatic conditions differ somewhat in various sections of
the country, we have tried to approximate the general average, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
that the suggestions might be as valuable to the housewife in New
England as to the housewife in the West or South, or vice versa.</p>

<p>Simplicity, economy and wholesomeness have been given preferred
attention in the preparation of these recipes, many of which
are here presented for the first time.</p>

<p>In the interest of health and economy a number of the recipes
suggest the use of Cottolene&mdash;a frying and shortening medium of
unquestioned purity&mdash;in place of butter or lard. Cottolene is a
vegetable shortening, pure in source and manufactured amid cleanly
favorable surroundings. It is no new, untried experiment, having
been used by domestic science experts and thousands of housewives
for nearly twenty years; to them Cottolene for shortening and frying
is "equal to butter at half the price, better and more healthful than
lard&mdash;and more economical than either." We, therefore, offer no
apologies for the small proportion of recipes specifying the use of
Cottolene, and suggest that a trial will convince any housewife that
Cottolene makes better food than either butter or lard, and is preferable
from the standpoints of efficiency, economy and healthfulness.</p>

<p>We commend this book to your critical inspection and test, believing
you will find it convenient, helpful, unique and pointing the way
to better and more economical living.</p>

<h2>For All Shortening and Frying Use COTTOLENE</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 30px;">
<img src="images/i-y.png" width="30" height="35" alt="Y" title="Y" />
</div><div class='unindent'>EARS ago nothing but butter or lard were used for shortening
and frying; to-day the visible supply of these two products
is insufficient to supply the demand, taking into consideration
the amount of butter required for table use.
Furthermore, as the demand increased it outgrew the supply of
butter and lard, with the result that prices were materially advanced;
and, incidentally, the quality has been lowered. Naturally, under
such conditions scores of substitutes have been offered as shortening
and frying mediums&mdash;some meritorious, but mostly inferior.</div>

<p>Cottolene is not offered the housewife as a cheap imitation of
either butter or lard, but as a vegetable product which is superior
to either for cooking purposes. Because it happens to be about half
the price of butter, or less, is but an additional reason, from a purely
economical standpoint, for its use. The main argument for the use
of Cottolene is the purity of its ingredients and the wholesomeness of
the food prepared with it.</p>

<p>There isn't an ounce of hog fat in Cottolene, and from cottonfield
to kitchen human hands never touch the product. It is pure and
absolutely free from taint or contamination from source to consumer.
Packed in our patent, air-tight tin pails, Cottolene reaches you as
fresh as the day it was made. Lard and butter are sold in bulk, and
do not have this protection.</p>

<p>Cottolene is always uniform in quality, and because of its freedom
from moisture it goes one-third farther than butter or lard, both of
which contain about 20% of water. It is much more economical
than lard; about 50% more so than butter.</p>

<p>Cottolene contains no salt, and is richer in shortening <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'properities'">properties</ins>
than either butter or lard. Two-thirds of a pound of Cottolene will
give better results than a pound of either butter or lard.</p>

<p>Because Cottolene is made from sweet and pure oils, refined by
our own special process, it makes food more digestible. Its use insures
light, flaky pie-crust; it makes deliciously crisp, tender doughnuts;
for cake-making it creams up beautifully and gives results equal
to the best cooking butter; muffins, fritters, shortcake and all other
pastry are best when made with Cottolene; it makes food light and
rich, but never greasy. Cottolene heats to a higher temperature than
butter or lard, and cooks so quickly the fat has no chance to soak in.</p>

<p>You can fry fish in Cottolene and use the remaining fat for frying
potatoes or other food. The odor of fish will not be imparted to
the other food fried in the fat. Cottolene is just as pure and healthful
as olive oil, and is unqualifiedly recommended by leading physicians,
domestic science authorities and culinary experts as wholesome,
digestible and economical. The use of Cottolene in your frying and
shortening will both save you money and give you better results.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>
<h2>HOW TO USE COTTOLENE</h2>


<h3><span class="u">The General Care of Cottolene</span></h3>

<p>Exercise the same care and judgment with Cottolene as you
would with butter, lard or olive oil; keep it in a moderately cool place
when not in use, just as you would butter&mdash;so that its best qualities
may be preserved.</p>

<p>Moreover, just because you occasionally buy strong butter or
rancid lard which your grocer has kept in too warm a place, you do
not denounce all butter or lard and give up their use; neither would
it be fair to condemn Cottolene simply because your grocer may
not have kept it properly. No fat will keep sweet indefinitely without
proper care.</p>


<h3><span class="u">The Use of Cottolene for Shortening</span></h3>

<p>Of course, the recipes in this book indicate the exact amount of
Cottolene to be used. In your other recipes, however, a general,
<i>and important</i>, rule for the use of Cottolene is:</p>

<p><b>Use one-third less Cottolene than the amount of butter
or lard given in your recipe.</b></p>

<p>For cake-baking, cream the Cottolene as you would butter,
adding a little salt; <i>Cottolene contains no salt</i>. For other pastry handle
exactly the same as directed for either butter or lard, using one-third
less.</p>


<h3><span class="u">The Use of Cottolene in Frying</span></h3>

<p>In <i>saut&eacute;ing</i>, <i>browning</i> or "<i>shallow frying</i>" (as it is sometimes
called) use only enough Cottolene to grease the pan. The Cottolene
should be put into the pan <i>while cold</i> and, after the bottom of the pan
is once covered with the melted Cottolene, more can be added as
desired. Add more fat when you turn the food.</p>

<p>Cottolene can be heated to a much higher temperature without
burning than either butter or lard, but&mdash;unless allowed to heat gradually&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Cottolene may burn and throw out an odor, just as would
any other cooking-fat.</p>

<p>For <i>deep frying</i>, have Cottolene at least deep enough to cover,
or float, the article being fried, heating slowly. For uncooked
mixtures, such as doughnuts, fritters, etc., test with one-inch cubes
of stale bread. The cubes of bread should brown a golden brown in
one minute; or test with a bit of dough, which should rise at once
to the top with some sputtering. Make this test always,&mdash;never
trust your eye. The fat should be kept at an even temperature.
For cooked mixtures, such as croquettes, fish balls, etc., the cube of
bread should brown a golden brown in 40 seconds.</p>

<p>Uncooked fish and meat are better when covered with bread
crumbs, to keep the crisp crust desired in frying food (see note on
Egging and Crumbing under Culinary Hints, <a href="#Page_12">Page 12</a>). The fat
should be hot at first, that it may not penetrate; then reduce the
heat, that the food may cook till done, without burning.</p>

<p>Crumbed food is usually arranged in a croquette basket before
placing it in the hot fat. This prevents the food from moving
about, which sometimes causes the crust to loosen from the food,
allowing it to absorb the fat.</p>

<p>Never let the fat heat to smoking point, for then it is burning hot,
and the food will burn on the outside while the inside remains raw
and uncooked. Cook only three or four pieces at once, for more will
chill the fat and prevent perfect frying.</p>

<p>After the food has been cooked by this frying method it should
be carefully removed at once from the fat and drained on brown paper.</p>


<h3><span class="u">Care of Cottolene After Frying</span></h3>

<p>After the frying is done, the fat should be allowed to stand in a
cool place to permit any sediment to settle. When cool, pour the
fat carefully through a double fold of cheesecloth, or through a
fine strainer. It is then ready for use.</p>

<p>Cottolene does not retain the taste or odor from any article
whatever that may be fried in it, and it may be used over and
over again. You may from time to time, add fresh Cottolene to it
as your quantity diminishes, but the frying qualities of the Cottolene
are not affected by the shrinkage of the fat.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'>HE high regard in which Cottolene is held by all those who
have made a careful study of food preparation and food
values is conclusively shown by the following testimonials
received from famous authorities on Domestic Science:</div>


<div class='center'><big><b>Mrs. Sarah Tyson Rorer</b></big><br />

Principal Philadelphia Cooking School and Culinary Editor "The Ladies'
Home Journal."</div>

<div class='center'><b><big>Marion Harland</big></b><br />

Author of the famous "Marion Harland Cook Book."</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Many years ago I discontinued the use of lard in my kitchen and substituted for it&mdash;as
an experiment&mdash;Cottolene, then comparatively a new product. Since my first trial of
it I can truly say that it has given complete satisfaction, whether it is used alone, as 'shortening,'
or in combination with butter in pastry, biscuit, etc., or in frying. I honestly believe
it to be the very best thing of its kind ever offered to the American housekeeper.</i>"</p></div>

<h2>HOW TO MEASURE</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 30px;">
<img src="images/i-o.png" width="30" height="35" alt="O" title="O" />
</div><div class='unindent'>NE cup, or one tablespoon, or one teaspoon, means a full
measure&mdash;all it will hold of liquid, and even with the rim,
or edge, of dry material. All measurements in this book are
level unless otherwise stated, and <i>the quantities indicated are
designed for a family of six persons</i>.</div>

<p>Stir up all packed materials, like mustard in its box, and sift
flour before measuring. Fill cup without shaking down, and dip
spoon in material, taking up a heaped measure, then with a knife
scrape off toward the tip till you have level measure. Pack butter
or Cottolene in cup so there will be no air spaces. A scant cup
means one-eighth less and a heaped cup about one-eighth more
than a level cup.</p>

<p>Divide a level spoon lengthwise for a half measure, and a half
spoon crosswise for quarters or eighths. A pinch means about
one-eighth, so does a saltspoon; less means a dash or a few grains.</p>

<p>A rounded tablespoon means filled above the rim as much as the
spoon hollow below, and equals two of level measure. It also equals
one ounce in weight, and two rounded tablespoons if put together
would heap a tablespoon about as high as would an egg, giving us
the old-time measure of "butter size of an egg," or two ounces, or
one-fourth the cup.</p>

<p>Except in delicate cake, or where it is creamed with sugar, and
in pastry&mdash;where it should be chilled to make a flaky crust, <span class="smcap">Cottolene</span>
or butter may be most quickly and economically measured
after it is melted. Keep a small supply in a granite cup, and when
needed, stand the cup in hot water, and when melted, pour the
amount desired into the spoon or cup. For all kinds of breakfast
cakes, it is especially helpful to measure it in this way.</p>

<p>Soda, baking powder, spices, etc., are generally measured with
a teaspoon, level measure, for this gives the proportional amount
needed for the cup measure of other materials.</p>

<h2>HELPFUL CULINARY HINTS</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="u"><b>On Methods of Cooking</b></span></div>

<p>Water <i>boiling</i> slowly has the same temperature as when boiling rapidly, and will do
just the same amount of work; there is, therefore, no object in wasting fuel to keep
water boiling violently.</p>

<p><i>Stewing</i> is the most economical method of cooking the cheaper and tougher cuts of
meats, fowl, etc. This method consists in cooking the food a long time in sufficient
water to cover it&mdash;at a temperature slightly below the boiling point.</p>

<p><i>Braising.</i> In this method of cooking, drippings or fat salt pork are melted or tried
out in the kettle and a bed of mixed vegetables, fine herbs and seasoning placed therein.
The article being cooked is placed on this bed of vegetables, moisture is added and the
meat cooked until tender at a low temperature. The last half hour of cooking the
cover is removed, so that the meat may brown richly.</p>

<p>In <i>broiling</i> and <i>grilling</i>, the object is first to sear the surface over as quickly as
possible, to retain the rich juices, then turn constantly until the food is richly browned.
<i>Pan-broiling</i> is cooking the article in a greased, hissing-hot, cast-iron skillet, turning
often and drawing off the fat as it dries out.</p>

<p><i>Saut&eacute;ing</i> is practically the same as pan-broiling, except that the fat is allowed to
remain in the skillet. The article is cooked in a small amount of fat, browning the
food on one side and then turning and browning on the other side.</p>

<p><i>Frying.</i> While this term is sometimes used in the sense of saut&eacute;ing it usually consists
of cooking by means of immersion in deep, hot fat. When frying meats or fish it
is best to keep them in a warm room a short time before cooking, then wipe dry as
possible. As soon as the food has finished frying, it should be carefully removed from
the fat and drained on brown paper.</p>


<div class='unindent'><span class="u"><b>Egging and Crumbing Food</b></span></div>

<p>Use for this dry bread crumbs, grated and sifted, crackers rolled and sifted, or soft
stale bread broken in pieces and gently rubbed through croquette basket; the eggs
should be broken into a shallow plate and slightly beaten with a fork to mix the white
thoroughly. Dilute the eggs in the proportion of two tablespoons cold milk or water
to every egg. The crumbs should be dusted on the board; the food to be fried should
be lightly crumbed all over, then dipped into egg so as to cover the article entirely, then
rolled again in bread crumbs. Sometimes, as in cooking fish, flour is used for the first
coating in place of the crumbs, the article being then dipped into the egg mixture, then
with crumbs and then fried.</p>


<div class='unindent'><span class="u"><b>Larding</b></span></div>

<p>Consists of introducing small strips of fat, salt pork or bacon through uncooked meat.
To lard, introduce one end of the lardoon (the small strip of fat) into a larding needle
and with the pointed end take up a stitch one-half inch deep and one-half inch wide.
Draw the needle through carefully so that the ends of the lardoon may project evenly
over the surface of the meat. Oftentimes, however, thin slices of fat, salt pork or
bacon are placed over the meat as a substitute for larding, although it does not give
quite the same delicious flavor or look so attractive.</p>


<div class='unindent'><span class="u"><b>Marinating</b></span></div>

<p>Consists of adding a pickle, composed of vinegar and oil, to the ingredients of some
combination used in salad making.</p>


<div class='unindent'><span class="u"><b>Cleaning Cooking Utensils</b></span></div>

<p>For washing dishes and cleaning pots and pans use a solution made by dissolving
a teaspoonful or so of Gold Dust Washing Powder in a dish-pan full of water. If the
cooking utensils have become charred or stained in cooking, sprinkle some Polly
Prim Cleaner on a damp cloth and rub utensil thoroughly. After scouring, rinse
the article well in hot water, and wipe dry. Use Polly Prim Cleaner also, for

<div class='recipe'>STEWED RHUBARB</div>

<p>Wash and trim off ends of two pounds tender rhubarb; do not
peel. Cut rhubarb in one-inch pieces. Put into baking dish and
sprinkle generously with sugar, add just enough water to prevent
rhubarb from burning. Cover and bake in oven very slowly until
tender but not broken. (Slow cooking preserves its color.) One
cup of Sultana raisins may be cooked with rhubarb. They must,
however, be first picked over, stems removed, then covered with
boiling water, drained, then covered again with boiling water and
cooked until soft. Arrange a layer of rhubarb in baking dish, then
a sprinkle of raisins and sugar and thus continue until all are used.
Finish cooking as directed in the foregoing. Serve very cold.</p>

<div class='recipe'>BOILED HALIBUT&mdash;COLD</div>

<p>Have a piece of Halibut cut weighing two and one-half pounds.
Tie in a square of cheese cloth (to prevent scum from settling on the
flesh of fish). Cover with boiling water to which add salt and
vinegar or lemon juice; the acid preserves the whiteness of the fish.
Boil until the flesh leaves the bones (about thirty-five minutes).
Drain and remove from cheese cloth. Pick out bones and remove
skin. Place in a vessel that will preserve the shape of fish, chill and
dispose fish on a cold serving platter on a bed of garden cress. Set
a cucumber basket at intervals (one for each guest), and serve with</p>

<p>Select long cucumbers of uniform thickness (three cucumbers
will make six baskets), cut a slice from both the stem and blossom
ends, pare and cut in halves crosswise; cut from each piece a section
so as to form a handle crosswise of cucumber. Scoop out the soft

chill and freeze. Fresh apricots or peaches may be used when in
season. The fresh fruit should be cooked until clear, in a syrup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Process</span>: Wash, pare and cut potatoes in one-fourth inch slices.
Wash, pare and cut turnip the same. Cover with boiling water and

three slices carrot, one spray parsley, a bit of bay leaf, three cloves, a
tablespoon salt and one-half cup vinegar. Bring quickly to the
boiling point, then reduce heat and simmer gently from twenty to
thirty minutes. Hard boiling breaks up the flakes of fish and
toughens the fibre. Drain from liquor, place fish on serving platter,
remove the skin and pour a few spoonfuls of Egg Sauce over the fish
and the remainder around it. Sprinkle finely chopped parsley over
all, and garnish with hard-cooked eggs cut to resemble pond lilies.</p>

<p>(For recipe see <a href="#Page_162">Page 162</a>.)</p>


<div class='recipe'>ROAST TURKEY</div>

<p>Select a plump, ten-pound young turkey; dress, clean, stuff and
truss in shape; place it on thin slices of fat pork laid in the bottom
of dripping pan; rub the entire surface with salt, sprinkle with pepper
and dredge with flour. Place in a hot oven and brown delicately.
Turn and brown back of turkey; then turn breast side up; continue
browning and basting every ten minutes until bird is evenly and
richly browned. Add two cups water to fat in pan; continue basting
every fifteen minutes until bird is tender, which may be determined
by piercing leg with small wooden skewer. It will require from three
to three and one-half hours, depending upon the age of the bird. If
the turkey is browning too rapidly, cover with a piece of heavy paper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
well-buttered, placed over turkey buttered side down. Remove the
skewer and strings before placing it on serving platter.</p>

<div class='recipe2'>GIBLET SAUCE</div>

<p>Drain the liquid from the pan in which the turkey was roasted.
Take six tablespoons of the fat, strain the latter through a fine
sieve. Return the strained fat to the dripping pan and place on the
range. Add seven tablespoons of flour, stir to a smooth paste and
brown richly, being careful not to burn the mixture. Then pour on
slowly while stirring constantly, three cups of stock (in which the
neck, pinions and giblets were cooked). Bring it to the boiling point,
and season to taste. Chop the giblets very fine, first removing the
tough parts of the gizzard; then reheat them in sauce, and serve.</p>

<div class='recipe2'>GRANDMA'S BREAD STUFFING</div>

<p>Remove the crust from two small baker's loaves; slice and pick
in small bits; season with one-half teaspoon pepper, two and one-half
teaspoons salt, one-half teaspoon powdered sage, and one medium-sized
onion finely chopped; mix well, using two forks; melt
two-thirds cup of butter in three-fourths cup boiling water; add to
first mixture; toss lightly with forks; add two eggs slightly beaten,
mix well, and fill well the body and breast of turkey. If bread is
very stale, more moisture may be added. If a crumbly stuffing is
desired, omit eggs.</p>


<div class='recipe'>CRANBERRY JELLY</div>

<p>Pick over and wash one quart cranberries. Seed two-thirds
cup raisins; add to cranberries; add one cup boiling water and boil
twenty minutes. Rub through a sieve, and add to pulp two cups
sugar and two-thirds cups scalded seeded raisins; cook five minutes,
stirring constantly. Turn into a mold previously wet with cold
water. Chill and serve.</p>


<div class='recipe'>SWEET CORN NEW ENGLAND STYLE</div>

<p>Chop one can of corn or two cups of green corn fine. Add three
eggs slightly beaten, one-half tablespoon sugar, one teaspoon salt,
one-eighth teaspoon pepper, one tablespoon melted butter and two
cups scalded milk. Turn into a buttered baking dish or into individual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
ramekins, and bake in a slow oven until solid or custard-like.
Serve in baking dish.</p>


<div class='recipe'>CREAMED ONIONS</div>

<p>Remove the skins from one dozen medium-sized onions, under
water&mdash;to prevent the odor from penetrating the fingers&mdash;or grease
the fingers before beginning to peel them. Drain, place them in a
sauce-pan, and cover with cold water; bring quickly to the boiling-point
and boil five minutes. Drain and cover with boiling salted
water; let cook uncovered until tender (about one hour), but not
broken. Prepare a thin cream sauce made as follows:</p>

<div class='recipe2'>CREAM SAUCE</div>

<p>Melt three tablespoons butter in a sauce-pan; add three tablespoons
flour; stir to a smooth paste. Add one and one-half cups
hot thin cream or milk; season with salt and pepper. Reheat onions
in sauce; turn in hot serving-dish, and sprinkle with one-half teaspoon
finely chopped parsley.</p>


<div class='recipe'>HOT SLAW</div>

<p>Shave one-half head white cabbage as fine as possible, using a
sharp knife. Serve with a dressing made of yolks of two eggs
slightly beaten; add one-fourth cup each of hot water and hot vinegar,
slowly beating constantly, four tablespoons butter, a few drops onion
juice, one-half teaspoon salt, and sift in one-half teaspoon ground
mustard and one-eighth teaspoon pepper. Stir this mixture over
hot water until it thickens to the consistency of cream; add to cabbage;
mix well; place on range, stirring constantly until mixture is
heated throughout. Two tablespoons of sugar may be added.</p>

<div class='recipe'>ROAST BRACE OF DUCKS</div>

<p>Dress and clean a brace (two) young domestic or wild ducks.
Truss same as goose. If domestic ducks are used they may be
stuffed. In the wild ducks place in each a head of celery; this is
thought to improve their flavor. Domestic ducks should always
be cooked "well done" and twice as long as wild ducks. Place the
ducks on rack in dripping pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover
breast and legs with very thin slices of fat salt pork. Place in a hot
oven and roast one and one-quarter hours, basting every five minutes
(with fat in pan) for the first half hour, afterwards every ten minutes.
Domestic ducks require a hotter oven than wild ducks or fowl.
When tender, remove string and skewers. Place on hot serving
platter, surround with Thorn Apples and serve with Olive sauce.</p>

<div class='recipe2'>STUFFING</div>

<div class='ingredients'>
2 cups cracker crumbs.<br />
1 cup English walnut meats broken in small bits.<br />
1 cup thick cream.<br />
&frac12; cup butter.<br />
1 onion finely chopped.<br />
1 teaspoon finely chopped parsley.<br />
&frac12; teaspoon celery salt.<br />
&frac14; teaspoon salt.<br />
<small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></small> teaspoon black pepper.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Process</span>: Crush crackers with the hands, not too fine. Add
nut meats, butter melted, cream, onion and parsley; mix well with
a fork; add seasonings. If stuffing appears too dry add more cream
(a cup of chopped apple or celery may be added). This is sufficient
stuffing for one duck.</p>

<div class='recipe2'>OLIVE SAUCE</div>

<div class='ingredients'>
4 tablespoons butter.<br />
1 slice onion.<br />
5&frac12; tablespoons flour.<br />
2 cups Brown Stock.<br />
&frac12; teaspoon salt.<br />
&frac14; teaspoon pepper.<br />
1 dozen olives.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Process</span>: Melt butter in sauce-pan, add onion and cook until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
delicately browned; remove onion and stir butter until well browned;
add flour sifted with seasonings, stir to a smooth paste and continue
browning. Add stock gradually, beating constantly. Pare the
meat from olive pits, leaving it in one continuous curl. Cover with
boiling water and cook six or seven minutes. Drain and add to
Sauce.</p>


<div class='recipe'>GLAZED SWEET POTATOES</div>

<p>Wash and pare six medium-sized sweet potatoes. Parboil ten
minutes in boiling salted water; drain and cut lengthwise in halves.
Arrange them in a well-buttered granite dripping pan. Make a
syrup by boiling one cup sugar with one-half cup water and two
tablespoons butter three or four minutes. Dip each piece of potato
into syrup and arrange in dripping pan. Bake until potatoes are
tender (about forty minutes) basting two or three times with remaining
syrup. Oven should not be too hot as these potatoes will
scorch easily.</p>


<div class='recipe'>"THORN" APPLES</div>

<p>Prepare a syrup by boiling two cups sugar and one and three-fourths
cups water ten minutes. Wash, wipe, core and pare the
desired number of apples (about eight for this quantity of syrup).
Drop apples into syrup when pared, to prevent discoloration. Cook
until tender, skimming syrup when necessary. Use a deep sauce-pan
for this purpose, as apples cook better when covered with syrup.
Better cook four apples at a time. Drain from syrup and fill the
cavities with quince jelly and stick apples thickly with blanched and
shredded almonds slightly toasted. Cut the almonds lengthwise in
three pieces, then divide, making six "thorns." It is best to toast
them in the oven until they are a golden brown.</p>


<div class='recipe'>HAWAIIAN SALAD</div>

<p>Arrange slices of canned Hawaiian pineapple, drained from the
liquor in the can, in nests of crisp lettuce heart leaves. Pile on these
Malaga grapes peeled, cut in halves lengthwise and seeds removed,
mixed with an equal quantity of English walnut meats broken in
pieces. Sprinkle thickly with candied cherries, cut in fine shreds or
chopped. Moisten with French Dressing No. 2.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
